# SnowJaws

Snowjaws is a clone of HipCamp. The Difference is it was designed to book and review Ski Resorts instead of Campsites. There are multi category features that allow users to swap between resorts based on time of the year or preferences between skiing and boarding.

# Conclusion

I really enjoyed making this clone, It easy to navigate through. This was my first project with introduction to React and Redux. I'm happy with the end result and am looking forward to tinkering with it more.
